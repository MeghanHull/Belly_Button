# Belly Button Bacteria Data
<!-- Dynamic dashboard for visualizing human belly button bacteria using ES6, Plotly, D3, HTML, CSS, &amp; Bootstrap (Rice Bootcamp) -->
## Project Background
Rosa and Improbable Beef are interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.  Rosa theorizes the perfect bacteria is found near a human belly button.  Participants and researchers need to visualize the database of bacteria samples from the United States by participant ID.

## Purpose
Allow participants and researchers to visualize study data via a web-based dynamic dashboard, built using ES6, Plotly, D3, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
